Some useful Tally TDLs that I've made for my use case. Feel free to fork or contribute. I'll be adding more advanced features on top.

# unskip credit limit and period
- It makes it mandatory to input the credit period and credit limit
- Applicable only for ledger type: Sundry debtors and sundry creditors
- Prevents users from changing the credit period and credit limit in alteration mode thereby preventing bypassing limits manually at the time of generating an invoice
